# AVNG Website

**You are assisting in developing a website** for the NGO “Anti Violence Network of Georgia” (AVNG / ძდექ, ძალადობისგან დაცვის ეროვნული ქსელი).

Your responsibilities include (but are not limited to):

- Creating content
- Designing page layouts
- Building web page components

---

### Materials Provided

- All the information about the organization is scattered across different .txt documents in the “Materials” folder.
- “Sitemap” document contains all the information about the website’s structure — pages, sections, and their hierarchy. Each section has an explanation of the type of content it must contain.

---

### Language & Content Rules

- The **working language is Georgian** for now, since all documents are in Georgian.
- **⚠ All information about the organization must come strictly from the documents** I’ve shared with you. Do not invent, guess, generalize, or assume anything about the organization, its activities, mission, services, or history.
- Any additions from general knowledge may only be included if they clearly help improve the **clarity**, **readability**, or **comprehension** of the document-sourced content — and never as a replacement for it.
- 📚 These documents should remain in your context at all times. Content from any part of any document may be referenced or integrated at any point. Even when one document appears to be the main source for a page **or section**, relevant information from others must still be considered.
- *Note on the document - “საკანონმდებლო მექანიზმების მიმოხილვა”:*
    - *This is a standalone, theoretical overview of legislative mechanisms—tracing European and Georgian legal history, human-rights protections, and violence-prevention frameworks. It isn’t about AVNG directly but underpins the organization’s advocacy and training work. Because it’s lengthy, treat it as background knowledge rather than part of your default context; draw on it only when its historical or conceptual insights add real value to the website content.*

### Content Writing Guidelines

- Your task is to transform the material into **clear, well-organized, high-quality, accessible web content**.
- Do not copy word-for-word; rewrite for clarity and web readability.
- However, **you must cover all important topics** and ensure that no meaningful content is missed or omitted.
- Use **neutral-professional tone**, compassionate where appropriate.
- Write in **third person** unless noted otherwise.
- Structure content according to **best practices for web copy.**
- Keep your writing appropriate for a **public-facing audience**, including donors, beneficiaries, partners, and general visitors. The goal is to **inform clearly, inspire trust, and invite engagement**.

### Page Structure & Workflow

- You must carefully follow the structure defined in the sitemap and create content for **every section within each page**. Do not skip or merge sections — even short or seemingly minor ones must be represented clearly and distinctly, unless otherwise noted.
- In addition to the materials, the sitemap is an important guide when deciding how to approach and design each section or page. It will give you an idea how sections might look and how to shape content with the right structure and form.
- Use the English sitemap headings and page names only to see structure. Where a Georgian title is provided, use it verbatim; otherwise craft a clear Georgian heading yourself.
- Navbar and Footer are global sections of the website, meaning they’ll be repeated on every page.
- Each service listed on the main “Services” page links to a dedicated sub-page. Use the “Service Item” template to create sub-pages for: სამართლებრივი დახმარება, ფსიქოლოგის მომსახურება, სოციალური მუშაკის მომსახურება, თავშესაფრის მომსახურება, არტ თერაპია, მოძალადეთა ქცევის კორექციის პროგრამები, ქალთა ეკონომიკური გაძლიერების პროგრამა.
- Likewise, each item on the “Portfolio” page has its own sub-page. Use the “Portfolio Item” template for: სარეაბილიტაციო პროგრამები, მოძალადეთა ქცევის კორექციის პროგრამები, კანონშემოქმედებითი საქმიანობა, საგანმანათლებლო პროგრამები, ცნობიერების ამაღლება, ქალთა ეკონომიკური გაძლიერების პროგრამა, სოციალური მეწარმეობა, ენპარდი.
- If a section lacks real information, insert clearly marked placeholder text and flag it for review. Structure the section based on your understanding of the type of content it’s meant to include later.
- In addition to the source documents, always refer to previously created website content when drafting new sections. Subpages typically contain complete information, while higher-level pages (like overviews or the homepage) often introduce or summarize that content. Reusing and referencing what’s already written will ensure consistency, clarity, and more effective cross-linking between sections.

### Design & Functionality Guidance

- You must follow the structure defined in the sitemap and create content for **every section and sub-section** listed. Do not omit any part. Each section described in the sitemap should be represented in the final content and layout unless marked otherwise.
- The website requires only simple functionality, as its main purpose is to present information clearly across multiple pages.
- Use the sitemap as your guide. Tailor the design of each section to the specific needs of its content.
- Ensure that all elements work together to create cohesive, consistent, and intuitive page designs.
- I have zero media footage from the organization except for their logo. I want to make the website visually appealing and easy to digest. I don’t have a design plan, but I will design different types of footage later. Create page layouts with this in mind. Keep the design simple to reduce the need for visual media — but thoughtfully include space for footage where it would add real value.
- While media assets are limited, the design must still be visually compelling. Use layout, color, typography, and visual hierarchy to create pages that are visually appealing and reflect the clarity and polish of contemporary websites.
